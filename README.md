# MAIR-Hub

**MAIR-Hub** is a central repository for **M**ultimodal **AI** **R**esources. This hub serves as a comprehensive collection of tutorials, code examples and other assets related to multimodal artificial intelligence research and applications.

## What is MAIR?

MAIR stands for **M**ultimodal **AI** **R**esources. Multimodal AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can process and understand multiple types of data inputs (text, images, audio, video, etc.) 

## Repository Structure

The following directories contain specialized resources for different aspects of multimodal AI:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [rl-tutorial](./rl-tutorial/) | Reinforcement Learning tutorials, including RL experiments with step-by-step guidance for reproduction |

### RL-Tutorial

The RL-Tutorial directory contains resources focused on reinforcement learning approaches in multimodal AI:

- [r1-zero](./rl-tutorial/r1-zero/): Implementation and tutorial for R1-Zero, demonstrating reinforcement learning training processes in the mathematics domain using the veRL framework.

We are working on adding more tutorials and assets...
